This project is mostly so I can practice making non-static webpages, but with a hopefully good use. The link above allows you to download Excel documents with one tab for each state/territory and it's quite clunky to use. Hopefully this site is a little better.

See TODO file for additional things I'm thinking about. Data viz stuff could also be cool.

For the Value column, I don't actually know if this is money that changed hands, or if the DoD gave the equipment away to the police departments and this is simply its book value.
